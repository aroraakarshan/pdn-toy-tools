# Static IR Drop Visualizer: Complete Development Plan

## Objective
Create a standalone, interactive, animated static IR drop visualizer as a separate tool from the existing SPR visualizer. This tool will create its own grid structure and visually represent instances (rectangles) and bumps (circles) on a grid, with best-in-class animation and educational features.

- **Bumps:** Render as filled circles with IR drop color coding.
- **Animation:** Smooth grid creation, instance/bump appearance, and IR drop value transitions.
- **Educational Tutorial:** Step-by-step explanations, tooltips, and interactive guides.
- **Performance:** Handle large grids efficiently using modern web technologies.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile and desktop friendly interface.
